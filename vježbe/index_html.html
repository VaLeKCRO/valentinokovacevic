	<p>Hey
Now it's time to go
From the white wards of England
The crows line the rivers and roads
I wanna walk where I know
Through the olive groves
The sky that knows my name
It gave me away
The magnolia moon
Like an eggshell, a white bell
To lighten my cold room
So let me sleep where I live
With a murder of crows
That live in the boughs of my brain<br></p>
